        <h1>Project Synopsis</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">
          WexEnergy is a sustainability focused company that aims to reduce carbon emissions with their unique window
          insulation technology. Their WexWindow product is a window insulation panel, designed to decrease energy flow
          through existing windows for both commercial and residential buildings. WexWindow helps maintain interior heat
          in the winter and keep exterior heat out in the summer, helping customers be more energy efficient and save on
          heating and cooling costs. For customers interested in adding WexWindows to their property, WexEnergy has
          developed an Android compatible application to simplify the quoting process.
          <br><br>
          Our job as a team is to expand upon WexEnergy's existing android application, while also making it available
          to iOS users. Throughout the project, we will work on improving the existing UI/UX to make the workflow more
          intuitive, create more documentation including a tutorial on how to use the application, handle edge cases
          during data transfers, do extensive alpha and beta testing for both android and iOS, and add a customer input
          form to the workflow.

          The team plans on doing two week sprints, starting and ending on Thursday, using scrum backlog management and
          sprint planning. We will use trello to
          host a scrum board where we will maintain our backlog and track our progress on tasks. We will meet as a team
          three
          times a week (Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday) where we each team member will participate in standup. During
          Tuesday meetings we will write out an agenda for Thursday for when we meet with the project sponsors.

        <h1>Metrics</h1>
        <h3>Product Metrics</h3>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
          Defect metrics: Keep track of errors in your artifacts: requirements, design, code, test cases, process
          definition etc. The best practice is to use a defect tracker and enter problems as they are found, and also
          track the status of the defect (found, assigned, fixed, deferred). From this information, you can derive
          several metrics
          <ul>
            <li>Defect density: number of errors per KLOC, page, use case</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Activity metrics:
          <ul>
            <li>Requirements metrics: Requirements volatility (% of requirements that were changed during each week)</li>
            <li>Documentation metrics: Create a document for all parts of the project including project overview, domain
              model, requirements and analysis, user stories and use cases, system design, implementation, testing and
              evaluation</li>
          </ul>
        </h5>
        <br />
        <h3>Process Metrics</h3>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-8">
          Progress metrics: These show whether project execution is on schedule
          <ul>
            <li>Earned value chart: Identify the activities for your project, and associate an earned value (# of
              points) with each. You earn the value (only) when you complete the activity - no points for partially
              complete activities. Plot total points earned against time</li>
            <li>Blocked time: measures how long a task stays blocked or unable to progress due to external dependencies
              or issues.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          Effort metrics: Keeping track of hours spent
          <ul>
            <li>Estimation accuracy: Planned vs actual effort for each activity</li>
            <li>Sprint Velocity: average story points completed per 3 sprints</li>
          </ul>
